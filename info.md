    - there seem to be multiple options to get to the data. One of them is the "URL" in the rigth column,
    - which points to https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/f10774f1c63e40168479a1feb6c7ca74/data

Overall set up of directory structure and software
==================================================

Directory structure for repository
<https://github.com/oscovida/oscovida>:

coronavirus-2020 (root dir of repository)
-----------------------------------------


-   [info.md](info.md) : this file, provides overview of current setup
-   [todo.md](todo.md) : things that need doing (programming/software
    engineering/data analysis)
-   [ideas.md](ideas.md): things that could be done; might need some evaluation
    first
-   [Dockerfile](Dockerfile): Dockerfile that allow execution of tests in
    container (could also be used for production)
-   [Makefile](Makefile): useful targets for tests and installation


coronavirus-2020/coronavirus
----------------------------

contains coronavirus package as the source required to create the plots

-   notebooks will import from this package 
-   this is the authorative copy of the coronavirus module


coronavirus-2020/tools
----------------------

contains tools to create static webpages at
<https://oscovida.github.io>, (repository to host webpages is
<https://github.com/oscovida/oscovida.github.io>)

in particular:

-   generate-countries.ipynb Notebook that creates all the static
    wepages for the world, and Germany, and US states

-   template-country.ipynb (used for world countries)
-   template-germany.ipynb (used for Germany)
-   template-US.ipynb (used for US states)

coronavirus-2020/tools/wwwroot
------------------------------

-   rootdirectory of <https://fangohr.github.io/coronavirus> and
    repository

-   files that are added to the repository
    <https://github.com/oscovida/oscovida>, and then pushed, will
    show up at <https://fangohr.github.io/coronavirus> a few minutes
    later

-   we use a separate repository (I.e. different from code repo) out of
    fear that it may grow quickly in size. At that point, we can create
    a new repository under the same name, as the history is pretty
    irrelevant: this is only to serve the most recent data in static
    html files.

-   The total size of html file for world and Germany is around 300MB,
    but the .git directory is smaller.
    
-   files in the `html` directory are created from notebooks. The notebooks are
    stored in the `ipynb` subdirectory.

-   The files committed to the webpages repository must contain the most recent
    `coronavirus` in the `ipynb` subdirectory and `requirements.txt` as those
    are needed by binder to execute the notebooks.

-   By also commiting the `cachedir`, people don\'t need to re-fetch the
    data on the binder service (fetching of the German data set varies
    between 1s and 60 seconds).

coronavirus-2020/tools/wwwroot/ipynb
------------------------------------

Directory that keeps the files required for Binder, so that people can
re-execute notebooks.

Plan: create an extra repository just for these `*ipynb` files, so that creating
a container for Binder doesn't need to clone the big repository that contains
all the html files. This is realised with the next section:

coronavirus-2020/tools/binder
------------------------------

-   repository <https://github.com/oscovida/binder> 

-   this started (24 May 2020) as a copy of the coronavirus-2020/tools/wwwroot/ipynb
    directory, but in a separate repository to make the binder start up time shorter
    (because this repo is faster to clone than the massive wwwroot one.)
    
-   for now, we rsync everything from coronavirus-2020/tools/wwwroot/ipynb to
    coronavirus-2020/tools/binder/ipynb
    
    In the long run, we could consider to write ipynb files directly into the
    binder directory.

-   The files committed to the webpages repository must contain the most recent
    `coronavirus` in the `ipynb` subdirectory and `requirements.txt` and
    `apt.txt` as those are needed by binder to execute the notebooks.

-   By also commiting the `cachedir`, people don\'t need to re-fetch the data on
    the binder service (fetching of the German data set varies between 1s and 60
    seconds). The downside is that the data will grow stale over time.
    (At the moment, 25May 2020, we don't copy the cachedir into the binder directory.)


coronavirus-2020/tools/pelican
-----------------------------------

Base directory of Pelican (static html generator) package.

- run `make html` here to create html in `../wwwroot`. Use this for development.
- run `make publish` here to create html that is meant to be pushed to the
  website:
  - `make publish` executes the settings is `publishconf.py` after having
    executed `pelicanconf.py`. As such, we get absolute URL in feeds, we get
    feeds with links to new articles. It also adds the google analytics tracker
    that we don't want for development, and javascript to enable disqus. (Not
    sure if we want the latter, but we might as well set it up while there is no
    traffic on the page, and then deactivate if we don't want it.)
    
    `make publish` also copies `ipynb` files into the
    coronavirus/tools/wwwroot/ipynb directory.

- the `generate-countries.ipynb` notebook creates files `germany.md` and
  `world.md` (and more) in pelican/contents

- `tools/pelican/contents`:
  - keeps markdown or rstfiles that pelican will turn into articles automatically 
  
- `tools/pelican/contents/pages`:
  - keeps static files (such as the welcome page), will also be turned to html
  
- `tools/pelican/contents/ipynb`:
  - contains notebooks that are rendered as normal articles by pelican
  
  

coronavirus-2020/archive
------------------------

-   files for history interest - can be removed soon. There were
    initially interesting to look up some things tried before.

coronavirus-2020/dev
--------------------

- collection of items that are work in progress or a useful reference for 
  developers.
  

Setting up a local installation for development
===============================================

1. clone git@github.com:oscovida/oscovida.git into your chosen directory
   X. This provides the source code.

2. Get the repository that keeps the static webpages (using github pages)
   `cd tools && git clone git@github.com:oscovida/oscovida.github.io.git wwwroot`
   
3. Get the binder repository:
   `cd tools && git clone git@github.com:oscovida/binder.git binder`

Procedure to update data and webpages (manual)
==============================================

[see below for automatic version]

4. update notebooks by running (in X/tools):

   - jupyter-notebook generate-countries.html:
     - updates all ~600 html files by executing ~600 ipynb files, which are created from the templates
   
   - jupyter-notebook generate-individual-plots.html:
     - updates image on home page (with one country out of the top 10)
     - updates plots on https://oscovida.github.io/plots.html with current data
   
5. in X/tools/pelican, run ``make html` to update html pages (to develop), `make
   publish` for the final version
   
   - if you want to see results, use `make serve` and open `http://localhost:8000`

6. in `wwwroot`, run `git add *; git commit *`, then `git push` 

7. updates should appear at https://oscovida.github.io a few minutes later

8. in `binder`, run `git add *; git commit *`, then `git push` 


Procedure to update data and webpages (automatic)
=================================================

Run script `tools/cron-job-update-webpages.fish`
