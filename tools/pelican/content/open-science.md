To use the analysis provided here, some Python knowledge is required, ideally
additional experience (or willingness to learn) about the Pandas data science
library and the Jupyter Notebook.

## Source code
All the computational steps and code are available
[here](https://github.com/oscovida/oscovida/tree/master/oscovida).

## Ways to use and execute the source code

* If you know your way around Github, you can fork [the
  repository](https://github.com/oscovida/oscovida/).

* All of the plots and tables can be recomputed using the Binder service (link
  in each webpage with plots and data, or use [go here and select the relevant
  notebook yourself](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/oscovida/binder/master?filepath=ipynb).
  
  This will provide a fully functional computing environment, that can be used
  from your browser. (But you need to download your notebook at the end of the
  session if you want to archive it or want to continue working on it later.)
