OCOVIDA provides an `open science <open-science.html>`__ portal to see and
investigate the COVID19 infections and deaths as a function of time for the
`US states <us.html>`__, the `districts in Germany <germany.html>`__,
and most `other countries <countries.html>`__ in the world.

Use OSCOVIDA to monitor the pandemic, second waves, local outbreaks and motivate
social distancing and support for other containment measures.

Read more about our `motivation <motivation.html>`__, `data sources
<data-sources.html>`__, `team <team.html>`__, or watch a `video interview <https://youtu.be/1_oDc_vptBQ>`__.

We provide a standard a set of analysis plots (`explained here <plots.html>`__) for different regions:

-  `List of all regions, countries and US states <all-regions.html>`__ 

-  `Overview for each country in the world <countries.html>`__ (Johns Hopkins data)
   
-  `States in the US <us.html>`__ (Johns Hopkins data)

-  `Counties (Landkreise) in Germany <germany.html>`__ (Robert Koch Institute data)

Occasionally, we try to provide `additional discussion COVID19 related news and numbers <tag-analysis.html>`__.

You can `fire up your own analysis environment in the cloud, select the relevant analysis notebook yourself, re-execute or extend the analysis <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/oscovida/binder/master?filepath=ipynb>`__. See also our (growing) `set of tutorials <tag-tutorial.html>`__.
